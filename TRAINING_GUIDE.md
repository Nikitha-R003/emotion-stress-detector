# Custom Emotion Model Training Guide

## What We Built

I've created a **complete custom emotion detection system** that trains models from scratch (no pre-trained models). Here's what's included:

### Features:
- **12 Core Emotions**: joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, love, anxiety, calm, excitement, shame, gratitude
- **LSTM Neural Network**: Bidirectional LSTM with 2 layers
- **Synthetic Dataset**: 3,600+ labeled samples (300 per emotion)
- **GPU Support**: Automatically uses your 4GB GPU if available
- **90%+ Accuracy Target**: Optimized architecture for high accuracy

## Files Created:

1. `train_emotion_model.py` - Main training script with LSTM model
2. `custom_emotion_model.py` - Model inference for the Streamlit app
3. `run_training.py` - Easy training launcher
4. `evaluate_models.py` - Model evaluation script

## How to Train the Model

### Option 1: Quick Training (Recommended)

Open a **new terminal** and run:

```powershell
cd E:\vskite\emotion_stress_detector
..\venv\Scripts\python.exe run_training.py
```

**Expected time:**
- With GPU (4GB): 3-5 minutes
- With CPU only: 10-15 minutes

### Option 2: Direct Training

```powershell
cd E:\vskite\emotion_stress_detector
..\venv\Scripts\python.exe train_emotion_model.py
```

## What Happens During Training

1. **Dataset Generation** (10 seconds): Creates 3,600+ labeled emotion samples
2. **Vocabulary Building** (5 seconds): Creates word-to-index mapping
3. **Model Training** (3-15 minutes): Trains LSTM on your GPU/CPU
   - 100 epochs
   - Batch size: 32
   - Learning rate: 0.001
   - Shows progress every 10 epochs
4. **Evaluation**: Tests on 20% holdout data
5. **Saves Models**: Creates `best_emotion_model.pth` and `model_info.json`

## Training Output

You'll see:
```

```

## After Training

Once training completes, you'll have:
- `best_emotion_model.pth` - Trained model weights
- `model_info.json` - Model metadata (vocab, labels, accuracy)
- `training_history.png` - Training plots

## Running the Streamlit App

After training, run your app:

```powershell
cd E:\vskite\emotion_stress_detector
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will automatically load your custom trained model!

## GPU Usage Guide

### Check if GPU is Being Used:

The script will print:
```
Using device: cuda
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650
GPU Memory: 4.0 GB
```

If you see `cpu` instead of `cuda`, your GPU isn't detected. To fix:

1. Install CUDA-enabled PyTorch:
```powershell
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

2. Check CUDA availability:
```python
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should print True
```

## Model Architecture

```
EmotionLSTM(
  Embedding(vocab_size, 128)
  Bidirectional LSTM(128 -> 256, 2 layers, dropout=0.3)
  Dropout(0.3)
  Linear(512 -> 12)  # 12 emotions
)
```

## Accuracy Breakdown

The model reports:
- **Overall Accuracy**: Single number (e.g., 94.5%)
- **Per-Emotion Precision/Recall/F1**: Detailed metrics
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows prediction patterns

## Troubleshooting

### "Training is slow"
- **CPU training**: 10-15 minutes is normal
- **GPU not used**: Follow GPU setup above
- **Reduce epochs**: Change `num_epochs=100` to `num_epochs=50` in code

### "Out of memory"
- Reduce `batch_size` from 32 to 16
- Reduce `samples_per_emotion` from 300 to 200

### "Accuracy below 90%"
- Increase `samples_per_emotion` to 500
- Increase `num_epochs` to 150
- Try different `hidden_dim` values (256, 512)

## Next Steps

1. **Train the model** using Option 1 above
2. **Check accuracy** in the output
3. **Run Streamlit app** to test it live
4. **Show your guide** the training logs and accuracy metrics
